_A key figure in France's dance music scene since the 90s, **Kiko** has an astounding back catalogue of music. We grabbed a quick chat with the Frenchman before he headlines sunday's [Zoo Events](https://www.facebook.com/z00project/) party._

**RR:** Great to chat [Kiko](https://www.facebook.com/KIKOMUSIC/) – we’re looking forward to your performance on Sunday. What kind of set can we expect from you?

**Kiko:** Hi! Well... I am going to play a lot of my own productions and try out some of my new tracks too.

**RR:** Sounds good! Now you've played in Australia a few times - how were those experiences?

**Kiko:** I’ve played in Australia about 5 or 6 times that. I played at [Babylon Festival](https://www.facebook.com/babylonfestivalau/) last year, with my old friend [The Hacker](https://www.facebook.com/DJTheHacker/). I love playing in Australia, people are very receptive to the music I play. My first time in Australia was in Sydney and Melbourne in 2002 or 2003.

**RR:** You ran a very popular record store in Grenoble. What was that period of your life like?

**Kiko:** I opened the record store in 1994, and thanks to that shop, I met The Hacker, [Miss Kittin](https://www.facebook.com/misskittin/) and [Oxia](https://www.facebook.com/OXIA.official/), who are all from Grenoble. With Oxia, I set up our first record label Ozone in 1995. Later we created the Goodlife label in 1997 with The Hacker. 

**RR:** You've dabbled in multiple genres including italo disco. What draws you to that style of music?

**Kiko:** Yes in Grenoble we love italo disco, because Grenoble is not very far from Italy. My favourite group as a reference is of course [Depeche Mode](https://www.facebook.com/depechemode/). My tracks are full of their influences.

**RR:** We gather that you have produced over 500 tracks! How do you keep finding fresh ideas for music?

**Kiko:** Music is like a therapy for me, I work every day in my Bunker aka studio - I’ve been doing that for 24 years now! I need to create, it's vital for me.

**RR:** You have a track with [Thomas Gandey](https://www.facebook.com/ThomasGandeyOfficial/) due out next month. Can you tell us a bit about the collaboration?

**Kiko:** I met Thomas Gandey via Facebook... he had already produced tracks with my friend [Oliver Giacomotto](https://www.facebook.com/oliviergiacomotto/), who I've known for quite a few years. I love his voice! As I’ve worked with Oliver for quite a few years now, naturally I needed to work with Thomas Gandey too. We have a track which was released in February on [Suara Records](https://www.facebook.com/suaramusic/) and another track that will be released on the 20th of April for [Stil Vor Talent](https://www.facebook.com/stilvortalent/).

**RR:** You also have a side project called [Minota ](https://www.facebook.com/Minota.music) which is signed under [Miguel Campbell](https://www.facebook.com/miguelcampbellofficial/)'s label. How did that come together?

**Kiko:** I know Miguel Campbell very well, he's like family to me and I love his label [Outcross Records.](https://www.facebook.com/outcrossrecords/). I was also doing house music 20 years ago with Oxia, under the name [Phunky Data](https://www.facebook.com/phunkydatamusic)

**RR:** Having worked in the music business for many years, what would you say has been the key to your longevity? 

**Kiko:** To work hard and and to never give up! And of course, surround yourself with good people - including your booking agent, manager, and press agent.

**RR:** And across your extensive career, which gig has been the most memorable for you?

**Kiko:** In 2011 and 2012, I toured with [Carl Cox](https://www.facebook.com/carlcox247/) for 2 years. It was such an epic experience.

**RR:** Finally - what else have you got coming up this year?

**Kiko:** This year I am going to focus a lot on production haha!

**RR:** Thanks for the chatting Kiko, we look forward to your set. 

**Kiko:** Thanks for having me!
