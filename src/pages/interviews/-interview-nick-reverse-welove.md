_Undoubtedly one of the finest DJs doing the biz in sunny Sydney, we caught up with [WeLove](https://www.facebook.com/welovesydneyunderground/) frontman [Nick Reverse](https://www.facebook.com/nickreverse/) for a chat about the brand and the things he loves..._
<br><br>

**RR: Hey Nick, happy new year! We saw you and your team smash it on New Year’s Day at [Space Ibiza on Tour](https://www.facebook.com/events/163826680868206/). How was the experience of hosting your own stage?**

Nick: Space Ibiza was just amazing this year, we had the pleasure of taking over the Chapel with [Nakadia](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/nakadia-welove) closing and such amazing local support... the dancefloor was on fire the whole time!
<br><br>

**RR: Sure was. We’re super excited that one of the Space headliners - Javi Bora, is playing at WeLove this week. What do you think we can we expect from him at the Burdekin?**

Nick: Javi always deliver the goods... his was my favourite set at Space Ibiza. I met him in 2016 and we became good friends. He’s already played three gigs for us and we’re really looking forward to having him play for us again on Friday.
<br><br>

**RR: WeLove has grown to become one of Sydney’s finest underground music institutions. How did the whole thing start?**

Nick: It started in June 2015 at the [Burdekin](https://www.facebook.com/BurdekinHotel/) as a weekly meeting for techno lovers that became a solid party. Then we had our first official afterparty for Space Ibiza on New Years Day 2016 and things took off…

**RR: Nice. If you had to pick one of your parties that really hit the spot for you which would it be?**

Nick:  That's a pretty hard question... I have so many good memories! Last Friday with Nakadia was so great… and I’ll never forget the 5 hour set by Markantonio & [Luigi Madonna](https://www.facebook.com/ravereviewz/videos/623591744658512/)… and many others!
<br><br>

**RR: And if you could bring down anyone for a WeLove party, who would you choose?**

Nick: There are so many good artists. We’re working on a few… let's keep it a secret for the moment haha.
<br><br>

**RR: Fair enough! Let’s talk about your own music career – how did you get into DJing?**

Nick: My dad had some turntables with heaps of funk which started my passion. At the age of 18 I started to play private parties, then clubs, and within a few years producing music became my life! I released my first EP and started to perform in Italy and Europe... then I moved to Australia when I was 25 and I think it was one of the best decisions I’ve made.
<br><br>

**RR: You’ve built a reputation for delivering some very energetic sets. Which of the sets you’ve played is the most memorable for you?**

Nick: I had a great time at [Subsonic](https://www.facebook.com/subsonicmusic/) Festival… and the terrace at [S.A.S.H](https://www.facebook.com/sashsundays/) a couple of years ago… also every time I play at WeLove I feel that energy.
<br><br>

**RR: You started a WeLove Recordings imprint earlier this year and released some stellar tracks including one of your own, Sun & Rain. Tell us where the inspiration for the track came from.**

Nick: The track came to me one day while I started to play with this synth and thought about how good it would be to have your own record label… so we did it!
<br><br>

**RR: Awesome. What else can we look forward to from the label?**

Nick: You guys should definitely check out our next release from [Javi Bora](https://magazine.ravereviewz.net/interview/javi-bora), which is out very soon!
<br><br>

**RR: Will do… and finally, what’s your new year’s resolution??**

Nick: We have a big vision for WeLove in 2018 with many surprises and collaborations… we had a great start to the year at Space Ibiza plus our first takeover at The Bridge Hotel. This year is going to be unreal…
<br><br>

**RR: Look forward to seeing it all take shape. Thanks for the chat mate!**
