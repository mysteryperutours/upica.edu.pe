_Before a blinding set on the Blueprint Cruise, we caught up with the event's headliner and all-round nice guy..._
<br><br>

**RR: Emanuel, welcome to Sydney. Youâ€™ve been here before right, how do you like it here?**

Emanuel: Thanks man. I love Sydney, it has a chilled out surfer vibe but itâ€™s also a busy city. I really like the mixture of busy and chilled.
<br><br>

**RR: Cool. Are you digging the Blueprint boat cruise?**

Emanuel: I love it man, everybody loves a boat party right? When I arrived I saw a bunch of pirates in the queue and I thought itâ€™s gonna be messy!

**RR: Sounds about right! Youâ€™re headlining today, how would you describe your style?**

Emanuel: Well, I definitely have a funkiness and a groove in my sets. An upbeat, uplifting vibe. I would say my sets are in between house and tech - the catchiness of house and the energy and drive of techno.
<br><br>

**RR: Great. Weâ€™re huge fans of the track 'Come As You Are'. It has a great old school flavour. Where did you get the inspiration for it?**

Emanuel: I was in Panorama bar, upstairs at Berghain, and I was influenced by this timeless housey sound that was playing that night. I wanted to make a track that had my style combined with that timeless house style. Then I stumbled across a sample that inspired me and it just came together super quick. I just had that night at Panorama bar in my mind the whole time and wanted to recreate that feeling.

**RR: Well it worked a treat. Youâ€™ve played all over the world, whatâ€™s your most memorable set?**

Emanuel: Itâ€™s impossible to say! I really like playing in South America, especially in Argentina. People there go absolutely nuts, the parties are always packed. Itâ€™s a great vibe. But I was in Africa last month for a little tour, playing in Angola and Ethiopia and it was really cool too. The scene is not so developed, but thereâ€™s this emerging passionate vibe which is awesome. The places where you donâ€™t expect house music to have a following, but it does. Weâ€™re everywhereâ€¦ weâ€™re taking over the world!
<br><br>

**RR: Haha, thatâ€™s right! Youâ€™ve done tracks on top labels like [Knee deep in Sound](https://www.facebook.com/KneeDeepInSound/) & Get Physical. Have you got any other tracks coming out soon?**

Emanuel: Yeah, I have an EP coming out on [Moon Harbour](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmoonharbour.com%2Flive%2F&h=ATOYov-fQVIcisTKQve_H0Xkwv8EIYQkKvsOCytzFYMiWio0KhWFBk33T8MAaZQp78bSXGl2s_W10kv8vsV7pt2yUkp1Ar0yE8OMJATzoQSAevmKBe2iwxmjlJmCxHB4mToWCSIB), Matthias Tanzmannâ€™s label in November. Some of the tracks arenâ€™t finished and Iâ€™m gonna road test them here so youâ€™ll hear some of them. Then I have a tune coming out on Reverb, which is a cool label from Italy, which Iâ€™m excited about. Itâ€™s a bit different, more deep housey, more musical. Then Iâ€™m doing a Body Language mix for [Get Physical](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getphysicalmusic.com%2F&h=ATMqHrDUKah07UeGpIPgpsrsJJJYAypeQbRNGCqdMw0fo_-FxAeU7Ausb5JMHqGQMykChAGTiSYHvv6G9-TrcaQOf30wUica_DvGqJiBqzbJJSBcEdzmDvR8014hrXJRCipMjQEp). Itâ€™s quite eclectic, something you can listen to at home.
<br><br>

**RR: Canâ€™t wait. Now, Iâ€™m gonna say some Australian slang and I want you to tell me what you think it means, ok?**

Emanuel: Go for it!
<br><br>

**RR: OK... Get amongst it?**

Emanuel**:** Erm.. does it mean, go fuck yourself??
<br><br>

**RR: Haha! No, itâ€™s like get involvedâ€¦ Bottle-o?**

Emanuel: Haha. Ok, Bottle-o? Does it mean as tight as the opening of a bottle??
<br><br>

**RR: Ha! Nope. A bottle shop, where you buy alcohol. Ok, whatâ€™s a bush doof?**

Emanuel: Ermâ€¦ sounds like a type of bird??
<br><br>

**RR: Haha, nah itâ€™s a party in the bush! Hopefully youâ€™ll make it to one while youâ€™re here!**

Emanuel: Haha. Thatâ€™s amazing, I hope so too!
