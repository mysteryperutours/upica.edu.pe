_With the summer heating up and [Electric Gardens festival](https://www.facebook.com/electricgardensfestival/) just around the corner, we caught up with Circoloco resident [Clive Henry](https://www.facebook.com/clivehenrymusic/) in the run up to the main event..._

**RR:** Clive, great to chat. We're hyped to see you play at Electric Gardens festival in a few weeks. What can we expect from your set?

**Clive:** The unexpected?? Seriously I just try and do my thing and hope people like it! I try not to veer from what I'm renowned for so I'll definitely be bringing my [DC10](https://www.facebook.com/Dc10IbizaOfficial/) Garden vibe to the party.

**RR:** Nice! The [Circoloco](https://www.facebook.com/circolocoibiza/) stage is a new addition to the festival. Circoloco is such a globally respected brand and you're a long-standing resident. What do you think has led to its success?

**Clive:** The reason [Circoloco](https://www.facebook.com/circolocoibiza/) has become what it’s become is because initially, it went against the grain of what Ibiza stood for at that time. It was a raw, heads down, back to basics, stripped back kinda vibe with the focus purely on the music. A lot of people didn't get it, and fair enough - it wasn't flashy or showy, but that's what I love about it, even now. Although they've had to change its philosophy slightly over the last few years due to the money pouring into Ibiza, the lads have re-invested a lot of money back in to the club and made it even better. For me it's still the daddy of most clubs anywhere in the world.

**RR:** You’ve played in Sydney before – what are your thoughts on the house & techno scene here?

**Clive:** I've always had an amazing time in Sydney - I've been coming over for years now and never had a bad experience. It's always been positive even with all the bullshit with the lock out and drinking laws. It’s a shame it's so far away cos I think more people need to experience it to be honest.

**RR:** Definitely! Now, you were one half of iconic tribal house duo Peace Division. Tell us about that time...

**Clive:** It was an amazing time as we got to travel the world and play some unbelievable clubs and parties across the globe. When you've come from nothing and worked hard in the studio to reach that point it makes it even sweeter. At first nobody really vibed with what we were doing but I remember [Derrick Carter](https://www.facebook.com/Derrick-Carter-8264478846/) played our first release on Basement 282 at a small Sunday club called Full Circle on the outskirts of West London… and everyone went nuts. That's when I knew we could be heading towards bigger things.

**RR:** We loved your recent remix of [Davina Moss’ Boiler Man](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fboiler-man-clive-henry-and-remi-mazet-remix%2F9819687&h=ATPUUSKc9fZKcnTJhEKWC2HHNb_l3EyohS4Rv576r1kpp2G3z0GxQAQzWhGzyL-ImUIcqCCF2gANd5jCghJXoI6Xjwj5tU42Ff9g7lOdkI2s5VPoyYvrq5at), with Remi Mazet. Tell us how it all came together.

**Clive:** Ah thanks nice to hear that you like it! Basically, I play for the label owner Dustin in Ibiza at a small venue called [La Guarana](https://www.facebook.com/guaranaibiza/) in San Eulalia and he said he had some stuff coming out on his label and asked if I could remix one of the tracks. So he sent us some bits and we chose that as we felt we could do something with it. Remi is the in-house engineer of the studio we share in East London and we just jammed for a couple of sessions spending some time finding samples that we felt would work, and that was it really!

**RR:** Any more tracks or remixes planned for the future?

**Clive:** Yeah we have a [Robert Owens](https://www.facebook.com/djrobertowens/) track to remix for a label called Bombis Records and another remix to do for Rob Anderson who works at Pioneer. Plus I’ve got a three track EP with Alex Arnout coming out via [Kerri Chandler](https://www.facebook.com/KerriChandlerOfficial/)’s Kaoz Theory imprint, we have sort of gone back to the Peace Division era where all the tracks are sample heavy. And I also have a collaboration with [James Dexter](https://www.facebook.com/JamesDexterFan/) called Think For Yourself coming out on his imprint Inermu. It's a four track EP featuring Tuccillo and various others... being released on vinyl only!

**RR:** Nice! Ok, tell us one track you like to play which always goes off.

**Clive:** Wow that's hard cos I don't really play out-and-out "bangers", for want of a better term. I'm more into getting people dancing and creating an atmosphere. I'm fundamentally a warm up DJ which has slowly become one of DJings lost arts… I think more DJs need to realise that not everyone wants to hear anthem X or some thumping tech house nonsense early doors.

**RR:** Haha! Fair play. If we asked to pick one set you've played which really stands out in your memory, which would it be?

**Clive:** It has to be the now sadly closed Studio Air in Tokyo. It was a mad space where you were virtually up in the eaves of the ceiling looking down on this quite small, intimate dance floor… quite disconnected from the crowd. I ended up playing with 2 bags of vinyl for about 6 or 7 hours. The fact that you were so far removed from the punters meant you could get on with doing what you do without anyone trying to be in the booth or asking you to play faster or harder, which does my head in! It was pretty special I have to say, cos everyone really got into it.

**RR:** You must have a hectic lifestyle... how do you look after your own wellbeing?

**Clive:** I used to have a personal trainer for a while and I used to cycle everywhere, but I've let it slip lately. It's something that I need to address in the new year, but I do eat quite well - I’m not into junk food unless it's a last resort, and I cook loads. I only try and drink when I'm playing too, but London has its pitfalls cos everyone wants to kick on quite a bit haha.

**RR:** Finally... we hear you were in to hip hop growing up. Who were your fave hip hop artists??

**Clive:** Ha that was a long time ago when it was just beginning and getting recognition... KRS One, [Big Daddy Kane](https://www.facebook.com/OfficialBigDaddyKane/), Afrika Bambaata, Mantronix, Public Enemy... the originators and roots of it all.

**RR:** Classic mate. Thanks for the chat!
