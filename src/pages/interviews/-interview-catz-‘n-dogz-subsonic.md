One of the undisputed highlights of Subsonic this year was the high-energy set delivered by Polish duo Greg & Wojtek, AKA [Catz ‘n Dogz](https://www.facebook.com/catzndogz.official/). We caught up with the house-trained animals after the festival to talk (pet) shop! 

**RR:** Greg, Wojtek, good to chat! You’ve just played at one of our fave festivals - [Subsonic](https://www.facebook.com/subsonicmusic/). How was the experience?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** We played there for the first time 4 years ago... that was our first time in Australia. We arrived after a 30 hour journey and we stayed for the whole festival without any phone service and nobody knew what happened to us haha! The festival was much smaller back then but we loved it, that’s our fave kind of music festival - the atmosphere is fantastic, lots of good music and people dance like crazy. This edition was huge!! So many new stages, lots of people… when we were DJing it was madness – it was raining and everybody was going crazy, we absolutely loved it!!

**RR:** So did we! Now, tell us how you picked your name - Catz ‘n Dogz!

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Long story short, we were looking for a new name after we wanted to switch our alias from ‘3 Channels’, a project under which we produced techno and minimal. We got into house music much more back then and wanted to have a funny name that would show how different we are. 

**RR:** We love your funky, bassy sound. Who would you say your influences are?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Since the beginning and even now, [Laurent Garnier](https://www.facebook.com/laurentgarnierofficial/) was one of the artists that we always liked. His productions and DJ sets were always an incredible combination of different genres and styles. We like artists who are diverse and explore all different sounds.

**RR:** Your album ‘[Basic Colour Theory](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Frelease%2Fbasic-colour-theory%2F1581023&h=ATO47eC8ZuzgaddsiyTSDKTXWNUGlWk-5dbw0wZZiuRQoS14kN76FVToHZ7Vn9KfL8mKj-MxCCVgSQ-O_nFfjSuBmEBr-JI60HfAvs-8smq7QoVKKGdTTbSF)’ will no doubt go down as an electronic music classic and the [remix album](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Frelease%2Fbasic-colour-theory-remixed%2F1708792&h=ATOgV-OfeSE0eafQFCl5D2ivC5jInJJWIspjkFWrN-d7OegysH16VpKq8f7TPMWDEpmYCufH3duKl9v51B-OlneV6zNiRQxzoUw-771K2tQ-r8gFXBhasjJmWaiCxX8154mZsQ) is dope. Tell us how it all came together, did you know it would be such a success when you were making it?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Thanks! We worked on that album for more than a year… it was somewhere around our 10th anniversary working together as producers and somehow that was a good time to reflect on the past, think about the future, check our influences and inspirations. we wanted to make this album the best possible and use all the production skills we’d learnt during those 10 years. The album is very personal for us and you can definitely hear the various genres and elements of music that inspired us to make it.

**RR:** The lead track from the album [Get It Right (feat. Tanika)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DebldM949Y5A&h=ATPtSJajRHapxrWdVGQvDx2A0VSkzAyhUMHmtzWjdGNdWUu7aYyqlfCUQTAmsLpANkk8rMiPAoNNjTsrP4owsAZ5BuHlqDqKnLPqF_F2Nt9JlhSDm5F1wHdP) was a big hit - where did the inspiration for the track and the video come from?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** We worked with Tanika in our studio in Berlin, that was a very funny 2 days… we joked around and recorded a lot of funny stuff. Some of the vocals were recorded in the background or breaks between the proper recordings! We did the music video in Warsaw… it was great fun, we involved over 100 people and shot in many locations across a week. It was our biggest video project to date.

**RR:** We loved your recent [Boiler Room set](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwCAB8zqnxP4%26t%3D2539s&h=ATNaBV2ap6A1SZyxFxYPEcjH0uc4YPKMKa6dEvHUdBgigjTi-SP6_hyfHcQPOxTsfKGSYjP4m-FU9lPZzgr1A1V9-nhArWyC100jz_67CDWIS_i3wgXtEVx1) in Poland - how was the experience for you? Did it feel different to the Boiler Room you did in 2013 in Berlin?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** We spent a lot of time DJing in Warsaw and have a lot of friends there. The city is changing like crazy right now… there a lot of great restaurants, galleries, clubs and creative people. The party was crazy! All our friends came, all the people that support us… it was next level. It was also was super funny to be there with Seth Troxler and hang out in our fave spots in Warsaw.

**RR:** Ok, of all the sets you’ve played, can you pick one that really stands out for you?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Hard to pick one as what we play depends on the party. I think the Boiler Room in Warsaw or the Resident Advisor podcast, Music for lovers podcast and Deep house Amsterdam podcast all showcase how diverse we can be as DJs.

**RR:** Tell us one track you like to play nowadays which always goes off.

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Marlena Shaw - [Woman of The Ghetto](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fwoman-of-the-ghetto-catz-n-dogz-remix%2F9563875&h=ATMO8twgBc6SL2hZ3jaMUwSzg_MnHhChMUlF29ENS3AE3rwrotnNOw56OiIebj37ECBKY2L6QvuMZausVGK4fCW7EVdqMJgP2E8RyQidTjyrpd7FycI9tssCfczusTjVDOGs_Q)[ (catz 'n dogz remix)](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Ftrack%2Fwoman-of-the-ghetto-catz-n-dogz-remix%2F9563875&h=ATMO8twgBc6SL2hZ3jaMUwSzg_MnHhChMUlF29ENS3AE3rwrotnNOw56OiIebj37ECBKY2L6QvuMZausVGK4fCW7EVdqMJgP2E8RyQidTjyrpd7FycI9tssCfczusTjVDOGs_Q)

**RR:** Your label Pets Recordings is doing big things… can we look forward to any releases from it soon?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Yes of course. But we aim for quality not quantity, so we are very selective with what we put out. Next EP is out now… it’s our single [Rave History](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2Frelease%2Frave-history%2F2139105&h=ATMGY65Df7r055XhO-lyIHw0WM0SZ7Zgt85d01JGCNNzMOg-I5d-P5LFKaJhbm-Xws7Y2_9M-BXnHuED9KZZAvBo584ZyW5zbzDOdxarYi_SHa3E_mtTXa2O). The video premiere will be happening soon, we shot it in Thailand.

**RR:** You’ve had a stellar career to date - what has been the highlight for you so far?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** Ah, we had lots of great parties in our career. We love coming here to Australia as well as USA where we had the best shows to date this year.

**RR:** Finally... what else do Catz ‘n Dogz have coming up in the future?

**Catz ‘n Dogz:** We blocked February off, so we can spend a full month in the studio to work on some new music, an album perhaps...

**RR:** Definitely excited for that! Thanks for the chat.
